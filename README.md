# TheOfficeQuiz

A quiz about the TV Show The Office.

## Overview

Based on the given Acceptance Criteria from the customer I was able to create a fun quiz. When you click the start button you are immediately presented with your first question. Upon answering each you are presented with a new question. When you answer a question correctly you are awarded a point. When you answer a question incorrectly you are given a 5 second penalty. When you run out of time the game is over. You are then allowed to submit your name to add to the list of high scores. Only the top 5 high scored are presented.
